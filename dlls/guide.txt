# Which dlls to use

ImageResizer.dll is always required. It includes all Basic plugins except Caption

Each plugin has a identically named DLL that is obviously needed.

The PsdReader plugin also requires PsdFile.dll
The S3Reader plugin also requires LitS3.dll
The AdvancedFilters plugin also requires FourCC.txt and all AForge* dlls

It is suggested that you also copy the matching pdb files as well, as this will greatly assist debugging.
