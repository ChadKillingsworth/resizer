 * Although I typically release my components for free, I decided to charge a 
 * 'download fee' for this one to help support my other open-source projects. 
 * Don't worry, this component is still open-source, and the license permits 
 * source redistribution as part of a larger system. However, I'm asking that 
 * people who want to integrate this component purchase the download instead 
 * of ripping it out of another open-source project. My free to non-free LOC 
 * (lines of code) ratio is still over 40 to 1, and I plan on keeping it that 
 * way. I trust this will keep everybody happy.
 * 
 * By purchasing the download, you are permitted to 
 * 
 * 1) Modify and use the component in all of your projects. 
 * 
 * 2) Redistribute the source code as part of another project, provided 
 * the component is less than 5% of the project (in lines of code), 
 * and you keep this information attached.
 * 
 * 3) If you received the source code as part of another open source project, 
 * you cannot extract it (by itself) for use in another project without purchasing a download 
 * from http://nathanaeljones.com/. If nathanaeljones.com is no longer running, and a download
 * cannot be purchased, then you may extract the code.
