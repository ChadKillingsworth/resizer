# Bugs

Settings serializion path should be simpler and correct. Currently, the drop-down is not serialized or deserialized, and resets each app start. I'm not sure even the querystring is serialized properly
App should not crash when settings file is missing.

# Incorrect behavior

Message boxes shouldn't ever be displayed when dragging or pasting files into the box.
Destination path should be editable.
lowercase extensions should be used.

# Code cleanup

Extract background worker to class.
ResizeMode should use an enumeration instead of magic numbers
Region areas should be removed - they're counterproductive, and make it harder to read code. Generally, they're a sign that the class needs to be broken down into smaller pieces.
Remove all uneeded dependencies.

# Design

Apply better typographic principles.
