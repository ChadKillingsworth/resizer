A fixed-size, private thread pool will be used to upload processed images. 

CanProcess will return false until the image is fully uploaded...
However, the data from the first CanProcess call for a request will be used to initiate the upload.

If the thread pool is full, CanProcess will return false until a thread is free to start the upload.

Tracking which files have been uploaded and which have not is difficult.
Initial version can simply do a HEAD request to S3 to determine the state, and memcache the results.


Configurable distribution name for the cache, allow cloudfront.

Only cache objects accessible under an anonymous user account.
