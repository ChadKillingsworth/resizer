//The Great CAIR Frontend. This baby will retarget Source using S_Weights into the dimensions supplied by goal_x and goal_y into D_Weights and Dest.
//Weights allows for an area to be biased for removal/protection. A large positive value will protect a portion of the image,
//and a large negative value will remove it. Do not exceed the limits of int's, as this will cause an overflow. I would suggest
//a safe range of -2,000,000 to 2,000,000 (this is a maximum guideline, much smaller weights will work just as well for most images).
//Weights must be the same size as Source. D_Weights will contain the weights of Dest after the resize. Dest is the output,
//and as such has no constraints (its contents will be destroyed, just so you know). 
//The internal order is this: remove horizontal, remove vertical, add horizontal, add vertical.
//CAIR can use multiple convolution methods to determine the image energy. 
//Prewitt and Sobel are close to each other in results and represent the "traditional" edge detection.
//V_SQUARE and V1 can produce some of the better quality results, but may remove from large objects to do so. Do note that V_SQUARE
//produces much larger edge values, any may require larger weight values (by about an order of magnitude) for effective operation.
//Laplacian is a second-derivative operator, and can limit some artifacts while generating others.
//CAIR also can use the new improved energy algorithm called "forward energy." Removing seams can sometimes add energy back to the image
//by placing nearby edges directly next to each other. Forward energy can get around this by determining the future cost of a seam.
//Forward energy removes most serious artifacts from a retarget, but is slightly more costly in terms of performance.
