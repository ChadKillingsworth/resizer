
This document describes several GDI+ bugs and how we avoid them.

Image and Bitmap classes - they require that the underlying stream stay open for the life of the object. 
If the managed reference is garbage collected, operations will fail.
They do not dispose of the underlying stream when disposed.

Cloning the image would cause all frames and metadata to be lost.

We solve the issue by cloning the stream into a MemoryStream. We then place a reference to the MemoryStream inside the Bitmap.Tag.Source property, which keeps it alive for the duration of the Bitmap instance.

All ImageResizer code first disposes Bitmap.Tag.Source, then the Bitmap itself.
