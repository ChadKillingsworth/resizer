
This document describes several GDI+ bugs and how we avoid them.




Image and Bitmap classes - they keep an unmanaged reference to the underlying stream open for the life of the object. 
If the managed reference is garbage collected, operations will fail.
They do not dispose of the underlying stream when disposed.

Cloning the image would cause all frames and metadata to be lost.

We clone the stream into a memory stream.
