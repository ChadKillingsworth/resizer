Plugins:

PrettyGIFs - Octree quantization and dithering for GIFs and 8-bit PNGs. Slightly lower than DefaultEncoder, but offers a fastMode option that uses the original image palette to speed up processing times. (feature not yet added)
AnimatedGifs - Resize GIF movies on the fly. PrettyGIFs plugin suggested. Caching is very important with this plugin due to long (.5s) processing times on long animations.
WatermarkOverlay - overlay a transparent PNG on any image using the querystring. Flexible alignment and scaling options.

Cairo/AForge resizing backends in the future? AForge uses the Bitmap class, so that's probably a safe choice.
